## Description
This is a web app that allows users to input a zip code and their current feelings, and then displays the current temperature for that location along with the date and feelings input. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the user's zip code input, and stores the user's input data in a Node.js and Express server. The front-end is built with HTML, Tailwind, and JavaScript, and the back-end uses Node.js and Express for routing and API calls.
